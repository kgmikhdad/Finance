### 1. Corporate Finance

**Capital Budgeting:**
- **Project Evaluation:** Analyzing potential investment projects and deciding which ones to undertake based on their expected cash flows and profitability.
- **Net Present Value (NPV):** Calculating the present value of cash inflows and outflows of a project to determine its profitability. A positive NPV indicates that the project is expected to generate value.
- **Internal Rate of Return (IRR):** The discount rate that makes the NPV of a project zero. It represents the expected annual rate of return. Projects with an IRR higher than the company's required rate of return are typically accepted.

**Capital Structure:**
- **Debt vs. Equity Financing:** Deciding the mix of debt (loans and bonds) and equity (stock issuance) to finance the company's operations and growth. 
- **Optimal Capital Structure:** Finding the right balance between debt and equity to minimize the companyâ€™s cost of capital and maximize shareholder value.
- **Leverage:** Using borrowed capital to increase the potential return on investment. Higher leverage can lead to higher returns but also increases financial risk.

**Dividend Policy:**
- **Dividend Payout Ratio:** The proportion of earnings paid out as dividends to shareholders. Companies need to balance paying dividends and retaining earnings for growth.
- **Residual Dividend Model:** Dividends are paid out from the residual or leftover equity only after all project capital needs are met.
- **Stock Repurchase:** A company buys back its own shares from the marketplace, reducing the number of outstanding shares, often to increase shareholder value.

**Mergers and Acquisitions:**
- **Valuation:** Determining the value of a target company using methods such as discounted cash flow (DCF), comparables analysis, and precedent transactions.
- **Synergy:** The potential additional value generated from combining two companies, such as cost savings, increased revenues, or enhanced market reach.
- **Due Diligence:** A thorough investigation of the target company's financial, legal, and operational aspects before finalizing the merger or acquisition.
- **Post-Merger Integration:** The process of combining and reorganizing the merging companies' operations, cultures, and systems to realize the expected synergies.

**Corporate Governance:**
- **Board of Directors:** A group of individuals elected to represent shareholders and oversee the company's management and strategic direction.
- **Shareholder Rights:** Policies and practices ensuring that shareholders have a say in important company decisions, including voting on major issues.
- **Executive Compensation:** Structuring pay and incentives for top executives to align their interests with those of the shareholders and motivate performance.

**Working Capital Management:**
- **Inventory Management:** Ensuring that the company maintains optimal inventory levels to meet demand without incurring unnecessary costs.
- **Accounts Receivable/Payable:** Managing the timing of cash inflows from customers (accounts receivable) and cash outflows to suppliers (accounts payable) to maintain liquidity.
